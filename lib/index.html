    <h1>give-me-dns.net</h1>
    You have IPv6, want to connect to some device and your router can't do mDNS or local domains?
    <br><br>
    Or, for whatever other reason, you want to be spared the pain of typing out an IPv6 address?
    <br><br>
    Then give-me-dns.net is just right for you!
    <br><br>
    Simply connect via a TCP client of your liking (like nc give-me-dns.net 9999) and you'll get a temporary DNS subdomain
    <br><br>
    You can also aquire a DNS name via the browser
    <br><br>

    Registered DNS Name: {{Res.DNSName}}
    <br><br>
    Expires: {{Res.Expires}}
    {{/Res.HasDNS}}
    {{^Res.HasDNS}}
    You don't have a DNS name registered
